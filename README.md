This repo helps me keeping track of some resources I read so I can find them afterwards. Also it gives me a feeling of accomplishment.

- Finished reading "It doesn't have to be crazy at work". I'm an awful reader. This might be the first book I finished in 14 years.
- Read [Smashing Magazine's Monthly Web Development Update](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/10/monthly-web-development-update-10-2018/). I learned about the text-only versions of [CNN](http://lite.cnn.io/en)'s (why doesn't http://lite.cnn.io/es work?) and [NPR](https://text.npr.org/)'s websites thanks to [this post](https://mxb.at/blog/hurricane-web/). Ended up in love with [Max BÃ¶ck's site](https://mxb.at/) which is super fast and very well designed. Noticed his integration with [Web Mentions](https://webmention.io/) and tried to implement on my blog, only to find out that the Twitter integration with IndieAuth doesn't work "Twitter login no longer works due to a change on their website".
- Read about [MDN's Layout cookbook](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook) with some flexbox and grid-based solutions for usual layouts.
- Started putting together some ideas about right-to-left support on websites. Drafted an outline for a post and when looking for resources I found out lots of interesting specifications for topics like hyphenation, cursives, bold, punctuation, uppercase and more on [https://w3c.github.io/typography/index] and [https://w3c.github.io/alreq/gap-analysis/]. It's not directly related with RTL but it's still interesting to keep in mind when supporting those languages.
