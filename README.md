This repo helps me keeping track of some resources I read so I can find them afterwards. Also it gives me a feeling of accomplishment.

- I read [Hard Costs of Third-Party Scripts](https://css-tricks.com/hard-costs-of-third-party-scripts/) and the resources linked from that post on CSS Tricks. It always feels good when developers flag the issues with third-party scripts. Unfortunately it's difficult to convince other parts of the organization aboy why this should be in the radar.

- I'm cleaning up my laptop. I didn't want to delete some videos about web performance experiments and explorations so I decided to upload them [to Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWOAK2KnodBRd8LYnUNW35g). A few short videos related with some posts I have written. Someone might find them interesting. Also, it's surprising the amount of stuff I can accumulate on a computer I have used for 3 years.
- While cleaning I found an immplementation of a React-like library called [bloop](https://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome) (see [the code here](https://gist.github.com/jlongster/11192270)). I went through the post 3.5 years ago as I was trying to learn more about how React worked. Libraries like these never get old.

- Finished reading "It doesn't have to be crazy at work". I'm an awful reader. This might be the first book I finished in 14 years.
- Read [Smashing Magazine's Monthly Web Development Update](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/10/monthly-web-development-update-10-2018/). I learned about the text-only versions of [CNN](http://lite.cnn.io/en)'s (why doesn't http://lite.cnn.io/es work?) and [NPR](https://text.npr.org/)'s websites thanks to [this post](https://mxb.at/blog/hurricane-web/). Ended up in love with [Max BÃ¶ck's site](https://mxb.at/) which is super fast and very well designed. Noticed his integration with [Web Mentions](https://webmention.io/) and tried to implement on my blog, only to find out that the Twitter integration with IndieAuth doesn't work "Twitter login no longer works due to a change on their website".
- Read about [MDN's Layout cookbook](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook) with some flexbox and grid-based solutions for usual layouts.
- Started putting together some ideas about right-to-left support on websites. Drafted an outline for a post and when looking for resources I found out lots of interesting specifications for topics like hyphenation, cursives, bold, punctuation, uppercase and more on [International text layout and typography index](https://w3c.github.io/typography/index) and [Arabic & Persian Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/alreq/gap-analysis/). It's not directly related with RTL but it's still interesting to keep in mind when supporting those languages.
